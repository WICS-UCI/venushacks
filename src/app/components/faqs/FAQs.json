        "question": "What is a hackathon?",
        "answer": "A hackathon is a 24 hour event where students of different backgrounds come together to collaborate on a project. Teams of up to 4 work together on brainstorming an idea and bringing the technology to life, and may present the project to possibly win some awesome prizes! You can also attend workshops, hear from inspiring speakers, and network with company representatives and fellow hackers."
